# Introduction to the Tidyverse:
# Data wrangling

### R-Ladies Frankfurt Meetup 2

This event was a tutorial in which we explored the tidyverse. 
The tidyverse is a collection of R packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share core programming principles. 
Thus, they are easy to learn and offer basic tools to quickly become an R user. 

In particular, we focused on some of the packages used for data wrangling: `readr`, `tidyr`, and `dplyr`.

### Data
Over this tutorial, we used tidyverse packages to import, tidy, and transform data from [TidyTuesday: A weekly data project in R from the R4DS online learning community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).
