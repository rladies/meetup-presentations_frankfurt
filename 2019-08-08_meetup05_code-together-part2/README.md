## Meetup 5

# Code together: From messy data to insightful visualizations - Part 2

This event was a live coding session. In this event, we wrote code in order to develop proposed plots. For that, we continued to explore the dataset introduced in [meetup 4](./2019-07-11_meetup04_code-together).

**Data**
In this session, we used synthetic patient data prepared by Natalie. The data consisted of two datasets:

* [base data](https://github.com/NFilmann/RLadiesFRA/blob/master/basedata.csv)
* [lab data](https://github.com/NFilmann/RLadiesFRA/blob/master/labdata.csv)

**Scripts**
This [R script](https://github.com/NFilmann/RLadiesFRA/blob/master/Viz.R) is an example of potential plots created out of this data.
