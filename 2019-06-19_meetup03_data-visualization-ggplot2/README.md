# Data visualization in the Tidyverse: ggplot2

This event was a tutorial in which we went through a workflow that explored how to go from a messy data to visualize our data by using `tidyverse` packages. In particular, we focused on the fundamentals for visualizing data using `ggplot2`. 

ggplot2 is a well known visualization package from the popular set of packages known as tidyverse. In general, the tidyverse offers a collection of R packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share core programming principles.  


### Data
Over this tutorial, we used data from the package `eurostat`, in particular, the dataset [`yth_empl_140`](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=yth_empl_140&lang=en).
