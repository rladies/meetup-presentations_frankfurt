## Meetup 4

# Code together: From messy data to insightful visualizations

This event was a live coding session. In this event, each of us wrote our own code. For that, we explored a new dataset by cleaning it and visualizing key information to tell a meaningful story out of our data.

**Data**
In this session, we used synthetic patient data prepared by Natalie. The data consisted of two datasets:

* [base data](https://github.com/NFilmann/RLadiesFRA/blob/master/basedata.csv)
* [lab data](https://github.com/NFilmann/RLadiesFRA/blob/master/labdata.csv)

**Scripts**
This [R script](https://github.com/NFilmann/RLadiesFRA/blob/master/Tidy.R) is an example of how we could clean these datasets.
